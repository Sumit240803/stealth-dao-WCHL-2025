## 🏗️ **StealthDAO Architecture – Canister-Wise Breakdown**

This architecture is built on the **Internet Computer (ICP)** and designed for **anonymous, democratic governance** using **zero-knowledge proofs** and **modular smart canisters**.

---

### 1. 🔐 **ShadowID Canister**

**Purpose**: Manages anonymous identity registration and enforces uniqueness via nullifiers.

**Responsibilities**:

* Register zk-based identity commitments (e.g., Semaphore, zkLogin)
* Store nullifiers to enforce one-action-per-user rules
* Allow ZK verification for identity group membership

**Why It Matters**:
Enables users to interact **anonymously but uniquely**, forming the privacy backbone of StealthDAO.

---

### 2. 📜 **ProposalHub Canister**

**Purpose**: Handles the lifecycle of governance proposals.

**Responsibilities**:

* Accepts proposal submissions (only from eligible, zk-verified users)
* Stores proposal metadata: title, description, status, creator hash
* Manages state transitions: Draft → Discussion → Voting → Closed
* Stores voting options and results

**Why It Matters**:
It ensures proposals are **valid, spam-free**, and trackable throughout the governance process — without exposing proposers’ identities.

---

### 3. 💬 **DiscussionBoard Canister**

**Purpose**: Enables **anonymous, open discussions** on each proposal.

**Responsibilities**:

* Stores comments linked to proposals
* Accepts comments only from registered ShadowIDs
* Optionally limits one-comment-per-user to prevent spam
* Allows voting or reaction tagging on comments (ZK optional)

**Why It Matters**:
Supports **transparent deliberation and feedback** on ideas, without linking any comment to a real-world identity.

---

### 4. 🗳 **ZKVote Canister**

**Purpose**: Handles **anonymous, one-person-one-vote** voting.

**Responsibilities**:

* Accepts zk-proofs that validate voter eligibility
* Prevents double-voting using nullifiers
* Stores encrypted vote choices
* Tallies final results and optionally proves correctness (ZK/homomorphic)

**Why It Matters**:
Delivers **fair, private, verifiable voting** — the core of any democratic system — while preserving voter anonymity.

---

### 5. 📈 **ReputationVault Canister** *(Optional but Recommended)*

**Purpose**: Tracks **anonymous reputation** per ShadowID to incentivize positive participation.

**Responsibilities**:

* Updates reputation scores after actions like voting, commenting, or proposing
* Stores and verifies reputation scores as zk-commitments
* Supports gating proposal rights based on minimum reputation

**Why It Matters**:
Creates a **merit-based governance layer** without revealing user identity, enhancing accountability while preserving privacy.

---

### 6. 🧠 **EchoAIProxy Canister** *(Optional but Powerful)*

**Purpose**: Integrates with external AI services to assist governance with insights and automation.

**Responsibilities**:

* Summarizes proposals automatically
* Generates AI rebuttals or discussion starters
* Tags proposals with relevant categories (e.g., "funding", "policy")

**Why It Matters**:
Improves governance quality by supporting **AI-augmented deliberation**, especially useful in high-volume or complex DAOs.

---

### 7. ⚙️ **DAOSettings Canister**

**Purpose**: Stores all **governance and system configuration settings**.

**Responsibilities**:

* Maintains parameters like:

  * Voting duration
  * Quorum percentage
  * Proposal eligibility rules (e.g., min reputation)
  * Use of AI assistant
* Allows upgrade and tuning via proposals

**Why It Matters**:
Enables DAO members to **govern the governance process itself**, supporting **on-chain configurability and evolution**.

## 🔄 **How It All Connects (Flow Summary)**

```text
User joins → ShadowID registered → Views or proposes → Discusses → Votes → Result tallied → Rep updated
```

Each action is routed through the relevant canister:

| Action                     | Handled By                           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Identity Registration      | ShadowID                             |
| Proposal Creation          | ProposalHub + ShadowID (ZK verified) |
| Proposal Discussion        | DiscussionBoard                      |
| Voting                     | ZKVote + ShadowID                    |
| Tally & Result Publication | ZKVote                               |
| Reputation Update          | ReputationVault                      |
| AI Assistance              | EchoAIProxy                          |
